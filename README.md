Imagine, walking through a spooky castle....

In the distance, you hear the rattling of chains...

Without apparent reason, the lantern you received at the entrance starts to flicker, and slowly fades out...

As you are staring at your lantern, wondering where the light went, it suddenly flashes brightly, and growling ghosts appear out of nowhere!

Would you feel at ease? We wouldn't!

Haunted Lantern is the first interactive “safe light’ for scare attractions such as (corn) mazes, ghost trails and other walk trough attractions.
The visitors of your scare attraction think that the light provides safety, but it is YOU who decides when and where their light starts doing special effects.
